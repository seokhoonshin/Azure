## Optimizing Pandemic Policy: Data-Driven Strategies for COVID-19 Management

This project evaluates the effectiveness of global COVID-19 policies to identify strategies that maintain case growth rates below 3% and death growth rates below 1%, while minimizing societal and economic disruption. By leveraging international datasets and advanced analytical tools, we provide actionable insights to guide evidence-based pandemic management.

Key Features

Policy Evaluation:

Assessed the impact of policies like workplace closures, public transportation restrictions, and stay-at-home orders using real-world data from multiple countries.

Data Processing:

Extracted, cleansed, and staged data using Azure Synapse and custom pipelines, ensuring analytical readiness.

Machine Learning Insights:

Applied machine learning techniques to compute correlations between policies and growth rates, identifying the least restrictive yet effective measures.

Visualization:

Developed dynamic dashboards and visualizations in Power BI to communicate policy effectiveness and support data-driven recommendations.
Tools and Technologies

Data Processing: Azure Synapse, GitHub

Visualization: Power BI

Analytics: Python, Machine Learning

Project Outcomes

Recommended moderate restrictiveness levels for key policies (e.g., workplace closures at Level 2 and public transportation restrictions at Level 1).

Highlighted the importance of flexible, data-driven strategies for effective pandemic control.

Future Directions

Incorporate real-time data for predictive modeling.
Extend analysis to economic impacts and public sentiment.
This repository provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing policy impacts using data science and machine learning. Explore the visualizations, code, and insights to understand how data can guide pandemic management strategies.
